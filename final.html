  <h1>à² à²¿_à²  Alright that is enough we both got work to do ðŸŽŠ</h1>
  <p>You are my best friend and whatever else you see me as you told me the other night it is hard for you to admit but this was fun to do and wanted to give you flowers</p>
  <p>I can point to any time in our friendship and say I knew something without realizing, but I do not regret knowing when I did, but that is all just the beginning</p>
  <p>I have more than an abundance of love for you Dahlia, and hopefully I see you Sunday by the way here's your flower</p>
